<h3>annotated sample sessions</h3>

<h4>the basics</h4>

<p>in this session we work with one single logger, the root logger, and we use only console handlers</p>

<p>start up R, load the library, use the basic configuration.</p>
<pre>
R> library(logging)
R> basicConfig()
R>
</pre>

<p>check the content of the root logger (loggers are environments):
after this basic configuration, it contains one handler.  this is
enough for some simple logging to the console.  the default logging
level of the root logger is INFO.  anything at level lower than INFO
will not be logged.</p>

<pre>
R> with(getLogger(), names(handlers))
[1] "basic.stdout"
R> loginfo('does it work?')
2010-04-07 11:39:49 INFO does it work?
R> logwarn('%s %d', 'my name is', 5)
2010-04-07 11:40:38 WARN my name is 5 
R> logdebug('I am a silent child')
R>
</pre>

<p>we add an other handler to the console, without specifying its
name.  it gets one automatically from the name of the function.  you
can add and remove handlers using their names.  you can also refer to
them by function, if that is the way you defined it.</p>

<pre>
R> addHandler(writeToConsole)
R> with(getLogger(), names(handlers))
[1] "basic.stdout"   "writeToConsole"
R> loginfo('test')
2010-04-07 11:31:06 INFO test 
2010-04-07 11:31:06 INFO test 
R> logwarn('test')
2010-04-07 11:31:15 WARN test 
2010-04-07 11:31:15 WARN test 
R> removeHandler('writeToConsole')
R> logwarn('test')
2010-04-07 11:32:37 WARN test 
R>
</pre>

<p>handlers are associated to a level.  any logging record passing
through a handler and having a level lower than the level of the
handler is ignored.  you can alter the level of a handler.  this is
what we do here: we alter the level of the default console handler
'basic.stdout' to 30 (WARNING).  by the way, also handlers are environments.</p>

<pre>
R> addHandler(writeToConsole)
R> setLevel(30, getHandler('basic.stdout'))
R> loginfo('test')
R> logwarn('test')
2010-04-07 15:17:40 WARN test 
R> with(getHandler('basic.stdout'), level)
[1] 30
R> 
</pre>

<h4>hierarchical loggers</h4>

<p>in the previous section we have worked -implicitly- with one
logger, the root logger.  we can refer to it explicitly: its name is
the empty string.</p>

<pre>
R> with(getLogger(logger=''), names(handlers))
[1] "basic.stdout"
</pre>

<p>when issuing a logging record, you can specify to which logger you
want to send it.  the logger will offer it to all its attached
handlers and then pass it to its parent logger.  loggers are organized
hierarchically, in a way that is similar to the way directories are
organized.  </p>

<p>just as directories contain files, loggers contain handlers and
their name is, within the logger, unique.  also similarly than to
directories, all loggers have one parent, except the root logger that
has none.  the name of the logger specifies the location of the logger
in this hierarchy.  an example will hopefully clarify:</p>

<pre>
R> loginfo('chiarastella', logger='libro.romanzo.campanile')
</pre>

if you define a logger by this name, all record you 

<h5>logging to file</h5>
<h5>formatting your log record</h5>
