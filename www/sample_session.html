<h3>annotated sample sessions</h3>

this is a minimal tutorial, showing by example what you can do with
and expect from this library.  this text is directed to scripts
authors who want to be able to log the activity of their programs.

<h4>the basics</h4>

<p>in this session we work with one single logger, the root logger, and we use only console handlers</p>

<p>start up R, load the library, use the basic configuration.</p>
<pre>
R> library(logging)
R> basicConfig()
R>
</pre>

<p>check the content of the root logger (loggers are environments):
after this basic configuration, it contains one handler.  this is
enough for some simple logging to the console.  the default logging
level of the root logger is INFO.  anything at level lower than INFO
will not be logged.</p>

<pre>
R> with(getLogger(), names(handlers))
[1] "basic.stdout"
R> loginfo('does it work?')
2010-04-08 11:28:35 INFO::does it work?
R> logwarn('%s %d', 'my name is', 5)
2010-04-08 11:28:48 WARN::my name is 5
R> logdebug('I am a silent child')
R>
</pre>

<p>we add an other handler to the console, without specifying its
name.  it gets one automatically from the name of the function.  you
can add and remove handlers using their names.  you can also refer to
them by function, if that is the way you defined it.</p>

<pre>
R> addHandler(writeToConsole)
R> with(getLogger(), names(handlers))
[1] "basic.stdout"   "writeToConsole"
R> loginfo('test')
2010-04-07 11:31:06 INFO::test
2010-04-07 11:31:06 INFO::test
R> logwarn('test')
2010-04-07 11:31:15 WARN::test
2010-04-07 11:31:15 WARN::test
R> removeHandler('writeToConsole')
R> logwarn('test')
2010-04-07 11:32:37 WARN::test
R>
</pre>

<p>handlers have a level associated to them.  any logging record
passing through a handler and having a level lower than the level of
the handler is ignored.  you can alter the level of a handler.  this
is what we do in the following lines: we alter the level of the
default console handler 'basic.stdout' to 30 (WARNING).  by the way,
also handlers are environments.</p>

<pre>
R> addHandler(writeToConsole)
R> setLevel(30, getHandler('basic.stdout'))
R> loginfo('test')
R> logwarn('test')
2010-04-07 15:17:40 WARN::test 
R> with(getHandler('basic.stdout'), level)
[1] 30
R> 
</pre>

<h4>hierarchical loggers</h4>

<p>in the previous section we have worked -implicitly- with one
logger, the root logger.  we can refer to it explicitly: its name is
the empty string.  this also explains that "::" in the messages sent
to the console, between the first and the second ":" there's the name
of the logger that is associated to the log record shown.</p>

<pre>
R> with(getLogger(logger=''), names(handlers))
[1] "basic.stdout"
</pre>

<p>when issuing a logging record, you can specify to which logger you
want to send it.  the logger will offer it to all its attached
handlers and then pass it to its parent logger.  loggers are organized
hierarchically, in a way that is similar to the way directories are
organized.  </p>

<p>just as directories contain files, loggers contain handlers and
their name is, within the logger, unique.  also similarly than to
directories, all loggers have one parent, except the root logger that
has none.  the name of the logger specifies the location of the logger
in this hierarchy.  an example will hopefully clarify.  </p>

<p>let's start from scratch, either a brand new R session or by
resetting the logging system.</p>

<pre>
R> logReset()
R> addHandler(writeToConsole, logger='libro.romanzo')
R> loginfo('chiarastella', logger='libro.romanzo.campanile')
2010-04-08 11:18:59 INFO:libro.romanzo.campanile:chiarastella
R> loginfo('memories of a survivor', logger='libro.romanzo.lessing')
2010-04-08 11:22:06 INFO:libro.romanzo.lessing:memories of a survivor
R> logwarn('talking to a upper level logger', logger='libro')
R> logerror('talking to an unrelated logger', logger='rivista.cucina')
R> 
</pre>

<p>notice that loggers are automatically defined by the simple action of
naming them.  what happened above is that the handler we created,
attached to the 'libro.romanzo' logger, only saw the records going to
the loggers below its logger.  all records going to upper level
loggers or to unrelated loggers are not logged, regardless of the
level.</p>

<p>also notice that the text printed doesn't contain any more that
"::".  between the two ":" there's the name of the logger that
received the logging record in the first place.</p>

<h4>logging to file</h4>

<B>TODO</B>
use the exported commodity function <tt>writeToFile</tt>.  you specify the name
of the file as an extra parameter <tt>file</tt> to the function <tt>addHandler</tt>.

<h4>formatting your log records</h4>
