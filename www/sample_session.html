<h4>annotated sample sessions</h4>

<h5>the basics</h5>

<p>in this session we work with one single logger, the root logger, and we use only console handlers</p>

<p>start up R, load the library, use the basic configuration.</p>
<pre>
R> library(logging)
R> basicConfig()
R>
</pre>

<p>check the content of the root logger (loggers are environments):
after this basic configuration, it contains one handler.  this is
enough for some simple logging to the console.  the default logging
level of the root logger is INFO.  anything at level lower than INFO
will not be logged.</p>

<pre>
R> with(getLogger(), names(handlers))
[1] "basic.stdout"
R> loginfo('does it work?')
2010-04-07 11:39:49 INFO does it work?
R> logwarn('%s %d', 'my name is', 5)
2010-04-07 11:40:38 WARN my name is 5 
R> logdebug('I am a silent child')
R>
</pre>

<p>we add an other handler to the console, without specifying it name.
it gets one automatically from the name of the function.  you can add
and remove handlers using their names.</p>

<pre>
R> addHandler(writeToConsole)
R> with(getLogger(), names(handlers))
[1] "basic.stdout"   "writeToConsole"
R> loginfo('test')
2010-04-07 11:31:06 INFO test 
2010-04-07 11:31:06 INFO test 
R> logwarn('test')
2010-04-07 11:31:15 WARN test 
2010-04-07 11:31:15 WARN test 
R> removeHandler('writeToConsole')
R> logwarn('test')
2010-04-07 11:32:37 WARN test 
R>
</pre>

<p>handlers are associated to a level.  any logging record passing
through a handler and having a level lower than the level of the
handler is ignored.  you can alter the level of a handler.  this is
what we do here: we alter the level of the default console handler
'basic.stdout' to 30 (WARNING).  by the way, also handlers are environments.</p>

<pre>
R> addHandler(writeToConsole)
R> setLevel(30, getHandler('basic.stdout'))
R> loginfo('test')
R> logwarn('test')
2010-04-07 15:17:40 WARN test 
R> with(getHandler('basic.stdout'), level)
[1] 30
R> 
</pre>
